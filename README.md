# Student Management System - C++

## Introduction

This project is a student management system built in C++, providing various features to manage student data efficiently. It consists of multiple screens that facilitate adding, updating, deleting, and displaying student records, as well as registering courses for each student.

## Project Components

### 1. Show Student List Menu

- Display all registered students in the system.
- Display students for each academic level separately:
  - First-year students.
  - Second-year students.
  - Third-year students.
  - Fourth-year students.

### 2. Add New Student

- Ensure that the **Student ID** is not already registered in the system.
- Add the new student to the system.

### 3. Delete Student

- Search for a student using **Student ID**.
- Delete the student from the system if found.

### 4. Update Student Info

- Search for a student using **Student ID**.
- Update student details after searching.

### 5. Find Student

- Search for student information using **Student ID**.
- Display student details when found.

### 6. Show Grades Menu

- Display students' grades and academic performance.

### 7. Manage Users

- Manage system users (if applicable).

### 8. Login/Register Screen

- Allow users to log in or register to access the system.

### 9. Refresh Student Data

- Reload student records to reflect any updates made to the files.

### 10. Logout

- Exit the program and end the session.

## Local File Storage Requirement

- The system is built using **local files stored on the user's computer**.
- To ensure the program runs correctly:
  1. Create the necessary files in the same **directory structure** as specified in the program.
  2. Alternatively, modify the file paths in the program to match your **custom directory structure**.

## How to Run the Project

1. Download or clone the project from [GitHub](https://github.com/waleedelhelw/student-mangment).
2. Open the project using an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) that supports C++, such as **Code::Blocks** or **Visual Studio Code**.
3. Compile and run the code.
4. Use the available menus in the interface to select different operations.

## Notes

- Ensure all required files are present before running the program.
- When adding or updating student data, enter correct information.
- The project will be improved and additional features will be added in the future.
